#  Linear Search (Unsorted Array)

# The linear_search function performs a linear scan of the array to find the target element (in this case, a student's roll number).
# It compares each element with the given roll number sequentially.In the worst case, the function has to scan through the entire array, 
# so the time complexity is proportional to the length of the array n.

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array 



#  Fibonacci Search (Sorted Array)

# The fibonacci_search function is a more advanced searching algorithm for sorted arrays. 
# It uses Fibonacci numbers to divide the search space,
# reducing the range of possible positions more efficiently than a simple linear search

# Time complexity: ùëÇ(logn), where n is the number of elements in the array
